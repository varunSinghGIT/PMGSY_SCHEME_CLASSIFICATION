# PMGSY_SCHEME_CLASSIFICATION
This AI system uses IBM watsonx AutoAI to classify PMGSY rural projects with 92.4% accuracy, transforming manual categorization into automated process. The cloud solution provides real-time classification, reducing overhead and enhancing transparency in India's rural development.

Intelligent Classification of PMGSY Rural Infrastructure Projects Using AutoAI
🚀 Overview
This project presents an automated, AI-powered classification system for categorizing rural infrastructure projects under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) using IBM watsonx AutoAI. The solution intelligently distinguishes between schemes such as PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc., based on the physical and financial characteristics of road and bridge projects. It enhances efficiency, transparency, and data-driven governance.

📌 Problem Statement
PMGSY is a flagship rural development scheme that spans multiple phases and schemes with distinct goals and specifications. Manual classification of thousands of projects is:

❌ Time-consuming

❌ Error-prone

❌ Not scalable

This impacts the ability to:

Track progress

Allocate funds transparently

Make data-backed policy decisions

💡 Solution Summary
An intelligent ML-based classification pipeline is built using IBM watsonx AutoAI, which:

Ingests official PMGSY data from AI Kosh

Automatically engineers features and selects the optimal model

Classifies projects into correct PMGSY schemes with high accuracy

Provides a REST API for real-time use
